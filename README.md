# RoR2-Tweak-Template

For an actual example using this framework, see [HarbTweaks](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/HarbTweaks).

Framework for tweak collections. While it doesn't make sense to use this framework for a single tweak, when you have a bunch of unrelated tweaks, it might be useful to use this.

A user can enable and disable separate tweaks on the fly, and you only have to write that specific tweak (only touch that file) to add a new tweak.

Also contains a template for visual studio in `Modules/`.
